=========================
## -- CONTENTS -- ##
=========================

## -- Core Code -- ##
simulator.c - Code file that contains the core code for running the thread simulator

scheduler.c - Code file that contains the scheduler functions.

scheduler.h - Header file that holds function declarations, macro defines, and DiskSectorRequest Struct

## -- Core Code Dependencies -- ##
stdio.h - Header file for standard input & output.

stdlib.h - Header file to access standard library

pthread.h - Header file to access pthread library, including pthread_mutex_lock pthread_mutex_unlock, 
            pthread_cond_wait, pthread_cond_signal, pthread_create, and pthread_join.

string.h - Header file for accessing string library, including strcmp and others.

limits.h - Header for accessing limit macros.

## -- Other Files -- #
makefile - File used for organized code compiling

input1 - Input example 1

input2 - Input example 2

input3 - Input example 3

=========================
## -- OTHER DETAILS -- ##
=========================

## -- Simulator Program Details -- ##
Program requires user to enter a valid file name
If input received is QUIT, the program will exit accordingly

## -- Code Compilation -- ##
To compile the code, enter the following in terminal in the program directory to execute the makefile:

	make

To clear the code object files, enter the following in terminal in the program directory to execute the makefile:

	make clean

To run the program, enter the following in the terminal after executing “make”:

    ./simulator

The program will then ask for you to input a valid file name to calculate seek times. Entering “QUIT” will exit the program.

## -- Code Additional Details -- ##
All parts of this program are functional and runs as intended.

## -- Language Version -- ##
This program uses C89.
